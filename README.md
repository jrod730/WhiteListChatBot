# WhiteListChatBot
I used this Poweshell script to post random comments in Discord chats during the NFT bull run in order to get white list spots to mint popular NFTs.

## How to use
* within @("Hello World", "add a statement 1", "Add a statement2", "add a statement 3")
* you should be able to add more statements by adding quotes "with words in the them followed by a common to add a new statement", "new statement"
* Open power shell by right clicking and selecting "run as admin"
* Copy this script and paste it within powershell window
* Open discord and leave cursor in discord chat window that you wish to automate
